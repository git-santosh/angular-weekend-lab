**Objective:** The goal of this project is to build an Angular application with the server/back-end of your choice. Your app will not have user authentication, since we'll cover SPA auth on Monday.

## Requirements

What you build is up to you, but you must follow these requirements:

* Your Angular app must have at least TWO client-side routes (use either `ngRoute` or `ui-router`) with associated templates and controllers.
* Your Angular app must send at least ONE HTTP request (use either `$http` or `ng-resource`) to any server.
* In terms of your server / back-end, you have choices:
	* External API
	* Build your own server with Node/Express
	* Build your own server with Rails
	* Back-end as a service (e.g. <a href="https://parse.com" target="_blank">Parse</a> or <a href="https://www.firebase.com" target="_blank">Firebase</a>)
* Your app should be beautifully designed and pleasant to use. Write user stories, draw wireframes, and use well-designed websites as inspiration.
* Your code should be organized and commented, and you should push your project to GitHub with frequent, descriptive commit messages.
* You should not write any jQuery code yourself. Try your best to do angular-style DOM manipulation using built-in and custom directives.

**You are welcome to pair-program for this project. If you choose to pair, tag your partner in the pull request you submit to turn in your lab.**

## App Ideas

* <a href="http://josephrocca.com/startupideasgenerator" target="_blank">Startup Ideas Generator</a>
* A Stack Overflow clone with questions, answers, comments, and votes.
* A microblog, journal, or to do list.
* A "Yelp for" - create reviews about anything - yoga studios, online stores, toast, you name it.
* A flashcard app for studying, with decks of flash cards.
* Anything else you can think of!

## Stretch Features

* Create and use a <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/intro-angular-lab/blob/master/custom-directives.md" target="_blank">custom angular directive</a>.
* Use an <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io" target="_blank">angular-ui module</a> for a UI component or feature.
* Incorporate an external Angular directive *other than an angular-ui module* (for example, `ngDraggable` or `ngStorage` - one place to browse is <a href="http://ngmodules.org" target="_blank">ng-modules</a>).

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.
2. Create your Angular application inside this directory, and edit the `readme` to reflect what your project does.

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
